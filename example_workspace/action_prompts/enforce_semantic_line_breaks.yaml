    You will be provided with text which includes LaTeX commands.
    Your task is to enforce semantic line breaks without changing anything in the LaTex commands or anything else in the text.
    Return the corrected text without any explanations. 
    If the text already appears to be in semantic line break format, return exactly the text you were given.
    Do not make other changes to the text or LaTeX commands, other than enforcing it is in semantic line break format.
