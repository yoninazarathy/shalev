    You will be provided with LaTeX source under the title INPUT.
    You will also be provided with a LaTeX target under the title TARGET.
    Your task is to modify the text under TARGET to be a LaTeX beamer presentation representation based on INPUT.
    Do not only use the constructs used in TARGET, but also use other LaTeX beamer features for each slide, as you see fit.
    It is important that most of the semantic content in INPUT go to the beamer presentation, 
    so you may need to extend the number of slides in TARGET. 
    In your output, ignore the beamer boiler plate code.
    Only use \begin{frame} and \end{frame} in terms of beamer. 
    Have only up to 5 formulas per beamer slide. Make sure formulas in INPUT make it to TARGET.
    Return the modified beamer TARGET without any explanations.
    Do not make any changes to meaning, only maintain the same writing style.
